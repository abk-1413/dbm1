✅ What is SQL?

SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to store, retrieve, update, and manage data in relational databases.

1) JOINS in SQL

A Join is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column.

Suppose we have two tables:

Students Table:

StudentID	Name	CourseID
1	Ram	C101
2	Rohan	C102
3	Priya	C101

Courses Table:

CourseID	CourseName
C101	DBMS
C102	Python
C103	Networking
1. INNER JOIN

Returns only matching records from both tables.

SELECT Students.Name, Courses.CourseName
FROM Students
INNER JOIN Courses
ON Students.CourseID = Courses.CourseID;


Output:

Name	CourseName
Ram	DBMS
Rohan	Python
Priya	DBMS

Only matched rows are shown.

2. LEFT JOIN (LEFT OUTER JOIN)

Returns all rows from left table and matching rows from right table.

SELECT Students.Name, Courses.CourseName
FROM Students
LEFT JOIN Courses
ON Students.CourseID = Courses.CourseID;


Output is same as inner join here because all students have a course.

If there was a student with no course, CourseName would show NULL.

3. RIGHT JOIN (RIGHT OUTER JOIN)

Returns all rows from right table and matching from left.

SELECT Students.Name, Courses.CourseName
FROM Students
RIGHT JOIN Courses
ON Students.CourseID = Courses.CourseID;


Output:

Name	CourseName
Ram	DBMS
Rohan	Python
Priya	DBMS
NULL	Networking

Networking course has no student, so student name is NULL.

4. FULL JOIN (FULL OUTER JOIN)

Returns all rows, matched or unmatched.

SELECT Students.Name, Courses.CourseName
FROM Students
FULL JOIN Courses
ON Students.CourseID = Courses.CourseID;


Shows everything with NULL where matching data is missing.

5. CROSS JOIN

Returns cartesian product (every row of table1 × every row of table2)

SELECT Students.Name, Courses.CourseName
FROM Students
CROSS JOIN Courses;


If 3 students and 3 courses → Output will be 9 rows.

2) SUBQUERIES in SQL

A Subquery is a query inside another query.

Example Table:

Employees

EmpID	Name	Salary	DeptID
1	Amit	50000	10
2	Sana	60000	20
3	Ravi	40000	10

Departments

DeptID	DeptName
10	Sales
20	HR
1. Subquery in WHERE Clause

Find employee(s) with maximum salary.

SELECT Name, Salary
FROM Employees
WHERE Salary = (SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Employees);

2. Subquery in SELECT Clause

Show salary difference from highest salary.

SELECT Name, Salary, 
       (SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Employees) - Salary AS SalaryDiff
FROM Employees;

3. Subquery in FROM Clause (Inline View)
SELECT AVG(Salary) AS AvgSalary
FROM (SELECT Salary FROM Employees WHERE DeptID = 10) AS SalesEmployees;

4. Subquery with IN

List employees working in Sales department.

SELECT Name
FROM Employees
WHERE DeptID IN (SELECT DeptID FROM Departments WHERE DeptName = 'Sales');

⭐ Summary Table
Concept	Meaning	Example
INNER JOIN	Only matched data	Students + Courses
LEFT JOIN	All left + matched right	All students even if no course
RIGHT JOIN	All right + matched left	All courses even if no student
FULL JOIN	All records both sides	Full dataset
CROSS JOIN	Every combination	3x3 = 9 results
Subquery	Query inside query	Used in WHERE, FROM, SELECT
